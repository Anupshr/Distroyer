A computer virus is a type of malicious code that can replicate itself and spread from one computer to another. It is designed to cause damage or disruption to a computer system, steal sensitive information, or gain unauthorized access to it.

Viruses can come in many different forms, including computer viruses, macros, and worms. A computer virus is a standalone piece of malware that attaches itself to a program or document and replicates itself to spread to other computers. It can be disguised as legitimate software or files, making it difficult to detect and remove.

Computer viruses can spread through various means, including email attachments, infected USB drives, and websites. They can also be spread through social media, messaging platforms, and other online connections. Once a virus is executed, it can perform various malicious actions, such as deleting files, corrupting data, or stealing sensitive information.

To prevent computer viruses, it is important to keep your computer and software up to date with the latest security patches and to use antivirus and antimalware software. It is also crucial to be cautious when opening email attachments or downloading files from untrusted sources, as these can contain viruses.

It's also important to have a good understanding of the basics of computer security, such as using strong passwords, avoiding suspicious websites, and avoiding clicking on links in emails or attachments.

In summary, computer viruses are malicious software that can replicate itself and spread to other computers, causing damage or stealing sensitive information. To protect yourself, keep your software and operating system up to date, use antivirus and antimalware software, be cautious when opening files from untrusted sources, and follow basic security practices.
